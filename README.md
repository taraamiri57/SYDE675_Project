# SYDE675_Project
## Directories
The repository is composed of several directories. The explanation of each directory is as below:
* DL Models (Paper code implementation)
  * A python file (.py) file for implementing Neural Network models (Dense, CNN, and LSTM) on the 2 Dataset
  * Results as figures and .xlsx files
  * BERT Directory including:
    * A python file (.py) file to implement the BERT model on the 2 Dataset
    * A dutch pre-trained model downloaded from:
    * Results (Figures and .xlsx files)  
    
* ML models
  * A Google Colab file (.ipynb) to implement the Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest) on the 2 Dataset
  * Results as figures and .xlsx files
  
* Dataset
  * Two Dataset as .xlsx files. One for the Fracture Radiographs and Chest Radiographs as .xlsx files


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Pycharm version: 3.8
