# SYDE675_Project
## Directories
The repository is composed of several directories. The explanation of each directory is as below:
* DL Models (Paper code implementation)
  * A python file (.py) file for implementing Neural Network models (Dense, CNN, and LSTM) on the 2 Dataset
  * Results for the Chest Dataset
    * Figures
    * .xlsx files including:
      *  df_neg_TRAIN_THORAX_20201006: training set with negative labels  
      *  df_pos_TRAIN_THORAX_20201006: 
      


   
  
* BERT Directory including:
  * A python file (.py) file to implement the BERT model on the 2 Dataset
  * A dutch pre-trained model downloaded from:
  * Results (Figures and .xlsx files)  
    
* ML models
  * A Google Colab file (.ipynb) to implement the Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest) on the 2 Dataset
  * Results as figures and .xlsx files
  
* Dataset
  * Two Dataset as .xlsx files. One for the Fracture Radiographs and Chest Radiographs as .xlsx files


## Technologies
Project is created with:
